## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1) BeReal:
   - Random Notification sent out to users
   - The camera takes a photo of front and back cameras
   - You can post multiple times a day if you submit your first BeReal on time
2) Snapchat:
   - A selection of face filters
   - Notification if someone screenshots your snap
   - Streaks
3) TikTok:
   - A personalized For You Page
   - Easy way to send tiktoks to other users
   - Ability to save drafts for later posting
4) Doordash:
   -Easy customer feedback for orders
   -Easy to leave a tip for dashers

App I would like to build:
I would like to build an app that allows users to log their whole closet and be able to simulate outfits. This would essentially make trying on outfits something that you could do from the comfort of your bed. It would have a search bar so that searching for clothing items could be especially easy. Users would be able to sort by article type (i.e. pants, shirts, belts). 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- It was difficult to navigate to the storyboard file because I didn't know that the main file was called main.storyboard
